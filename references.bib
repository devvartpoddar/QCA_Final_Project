abstract = {In this paper, a new probabilistic tagging method is presented which avoids problems that Markov Model based taggers face, when they have to estimate transition probabilities from sparse data. In this tagging method, transition probabilities are estimated using a decision tree. Based on this method, a part-of-speech tagger (called TreeTagger) has been implemented which achieves 96.36 {\%} accuracy on Penn-Treebank data which is better than that of a trigram tagger (96.06 {\%}) on the same data. Keywords: Corpus-based NLP, Statistical NLP, Part-of-Speech Tagging. 1 Introduction Word forms are often ambiguous in their part-of-speech (POS). The English word form store for example can be either a noun, a finite verb or an infinitive. In an utterance, this ambiguity is normally resolved by the context of a word: e.g. in the sentence "The 1977 PCs could store two pages of data.", store can only be an infinitive. The predictability of the part-of-speech from the context is used by automatic part-...},

@article{Blei2003,
abstract = {We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

@article{Merz2016,
abstract = {This article presents a digital, open-access, multilingual, annotated corpus of electoral programs. It complements the recent methodological innovations in (semi-) computerized content analysis by providing a large, standardized text corpus for the political science community. The corpus is based on the collection of the Manifesto Project, which comprises of (at the time of writing) the largest hand-annotated text corpus of electoral programs available. Since 2009 the project's costly and time-intensive procedure of collecting and coding documents has been fully digitized. As a result, it now provides more than 1800 machine readable documents from 40 different countries. Six hundred of these documents contain content-analyzed annotations at the level of single (quasi-) sentences, which correspond to the Manifesto Project coding scheme. Additionally, the corpus will continually be extended by incorporating new elections and digitizing older documents. The database also provides meta-information for each do...},
